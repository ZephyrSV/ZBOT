# ZBOT
My discord bot source code

This is my first code in JS... I haven't taken any classes on js, I mainly program in C and C++.\n
I am sure my code is quite terrible but it does the job.\n
\n
My bot has these features:
 - It can create temporary channels
 - It can read rss feeds and notify users (every hour) or servers (every minute) if a new item was published in that feed
 - It can search through a google sheets to find info on a bullet (for tarkov) -> although this is not a good solution and the wiki does it better
